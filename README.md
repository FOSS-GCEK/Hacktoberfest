# Hacktoberfest
The purpose of this repo is three-fold:
1. To get beginners familiarised with git, github and the concept of commits and pull requests (via the incentive of hacktoberfest).
2. To create a database of basic and interesting programs that beginners can take a look at. 
3. To create a list of FOSS enthusiasts of GCEK

*Please submit a pull request only if you're a student of GCEK. Other pull requests will not be accepted.*

## Steps:
1. Fork this repo
2. Add a new .md (markdown) file with your name, year of joining and branch. 
3. Type in a program you found interesting. Remember to [format it](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#code-and-syntax-highlighting) properly. Commit the changes.
4. Open a pull request to [FOSS-GCEK/Hacktoberfest](https://github.com/FOSS-GCEK/Hacktoberfest/pulls)
5. Congrats - you just created your first pull request!

You also navigated the intricate process of figuring out how to do this all by yourself. Kudos to you!

This time, you need 4 PULL REQUESTS to complete the challenge. Check [Issues](https://github.com/FOSS-GCEK/Hacktoberfest/issues) section of this project for more.

Now, if you're wondering how to begin contributing to other open source projects, here is a [good page](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/how-to-contribute-to-open-source) with resources you can refer to. You can contribute not just via code, but also by solving bugs or writing documentation or collating resources. **Good luck, and we hope you put in enough effort over the course of the month towards your pull requests so you feel really happy and satisfied when you recieve that t-shirt!**
